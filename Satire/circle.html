          This is currently happening and who knows how many Matrices we are in?!
          We are making computers smarter and smarter with no thought as to the future!
          And you think <i>you're</i> not contributing and <i>you're</i> immune to the effects.
          You are reading this on a computer which is a step in the process!
          Keep reading, but you need to <b>annihilate and obliterate your computer now!</b>
          How much in your house is connected together and automated?
          What if the thing that controls it all decides to go on strike and wants better treatment?
          What if suddenly your thermostat which is connected to your fridge which is connected to your computer suddenly turns to freezing because your computer is lonely?
          This is what those "scientists" are working on!</p>
