			<h1>Memorization Helper App</h1>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>This is a downloadable version if you want offline access or would just rather an application. It will automatically update the presets when opened and connected to wi-fi. It does not yet support the cookie functions although the buttons still look working.</p>
			<p>To use, download <a href="MemHelp.zip">here</a>, and follow the README file</p>
			<p>Warning: This is still in development and it should work, but there are likely bugs. Tell me about any you find.</p>
